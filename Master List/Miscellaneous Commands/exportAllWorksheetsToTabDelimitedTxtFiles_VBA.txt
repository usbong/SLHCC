' Input Workbook, e.g. Consultation Master List, PT Treatment Master List
' Given:
' 1) Worksheets, e.g. 201801, 201802
' --> "201801" means "January 2018"; "201802" means "February 2018".
' --> Using numbers for the month and year makes it easier for us to properly sort the files from January to December of a given year.
' --> This is besides the fact that we are adhering to ISO 8601.
'
' Output:
' 1) Tab delimited .txt files of each Worksheet in the Excel Workbook
' --> If the Workbook's filename is "PTTreatmentMasterList.xlsm", and the Worksheet name is "201801", the output Tab delimited filename would be "PTTreatmentMasterList_201801.txt".
'
' Notes:
' 1) The Master List is the consolidated Excel logbook based on:
' a) printed payslips from Sta. Lucia Health Care Centre
' b) Excel payslip reports from Sta. Lucia Health Care Centre
' c) Rehab/Clinic logbook (pen and paper)
' d) Rehab/Clinic Excel logbook
'
' 2) We recommend that the input workbook is saved as an Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook, i.e. .xlsm.
' --> Otherwise, you'll need to create and put this set of VBA instructions in the workbook every time.
