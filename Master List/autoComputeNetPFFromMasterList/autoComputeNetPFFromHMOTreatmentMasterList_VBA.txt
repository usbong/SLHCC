' Given:
' 1) Class, i.e. HMO... (Column I)
'
'Output:
' 1) Auto-computed Net PF for HMO payments (Column K)
' 2) AMT.PAID (Column J)
'
'Notes:
' 1) The Master List is the consolidated Excel logbook based on:
' a) Excel HMO payment reports from Sta. Lucia
' b) Rehab/Clinic logbook (pen and paper)
' c) Rehab/Clinic Excel logbook
'
' 2) In the Master List/verified Excel Logbook, I inserted a new column at column A for my notes
'
' 3) This auto-computation applies to all the months of 2018, except March.
' --> In March 2018, 0.9 was updated to 0.92 due to a change in the EWT (Expanded Withholding Tax)
' --> However, this update was not applied in actuality.
' --> This may be likely due to while the transaction was in March 2018, the payment from the HMO was not actually given in March 2018.
