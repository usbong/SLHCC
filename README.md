<b>Description:</b></br>
This is a set of add-on software to automate computing tasks of Microsoft Excel logbooks.</br>

# Add-on Software
We've written the add-on software using among others:<br>
a) Visual Basic Application (VBA) that we execute as instructions/Macros on Microsoft Excel</br>
b) Java programming language

# Summary Report File Encryption
### Note: I've verified that the steps that I've written here work on Microsoft Office 2013. 
To encrypt our Summary Reports in PDF (Portable Document Format), we have to do the following:</br>
1) We transfer the specific Microsoft Excel worksheet with the Summary Report from the Excel logbook/workbook to Microsoft Word.</br>
2) In Microsoft Word, we click "File" -> "Save As".</br>
3) In the "Save As" Window, we select for the "Save as type:" dropdown menu, "PDF (\*.pdf)".</br>
4) Before clicking the "Save" button, we click on its left, "Tools" -> "General Options..."</br>
5) In the "General Options" Window, we enter for both the "Password to open:" and the "Password to modify:" fields their respective passwords or verification codes.</br>
6) In the "General Options" Window, we also put a check on the "read-only Recommended" checkbox.</br>
7) In the "General Options" Window, we click "OK".</br>
8) In the "Save As" Window, we click "Save".</br>

Done!
