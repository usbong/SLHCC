### REQUIREMENTS:
1) Java Standard Edition (SE) 8: [Java Run-time Environment (JRE)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) or [Java Sofware Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)</br>
2) Windows Operating System (OS) 
#### NOTES:
a) At present, the add-on software does not connect to the internet, and is only accessible in the local network.</br>
--> Therefore, the 8th version should suffice.</br></br>
b) If you are using Windows OS 32-bit (x86) on your computer, you must download the appropriate Java Standard Edition (SE) for that OS.</br>
--> It can either be the Java Run-time Environment (JRE) or the Java Sofware Development Kit (JDK).</br>
--> If you will need to modify the Java code, we recommend that you download the JDK.</br>
--> Otherwise, the JRE should suffice.</br></br>
c) The pre-compiled Java class should be executable on other OS's, e.g. Linux.</br>
--> However, you may have to rewrite the batch file, "generateMonthlySummaryReport.bat", using BShell (Bash Shell).</br>
--> This is to be able to execute it on, for example, Linux.
